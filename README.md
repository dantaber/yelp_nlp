# NLP of Yelp reviews

This repository contains files related to an NLP project that compared topics that different Yelp users write about in reviews. I was particularly interested in whether reviews that were positive, "useful" (based on useful votes), or "elite" (Elite Yelp users) focused on different topics compared to other reviews. Why? Because these reviews are generally more valuable to businesses due to Elite users' clout and because of how Yelp sorts reviews to favor those that are "useful".

Data were obtained from the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), and non-negative matrix factorization and PCA were ultimately used to select topics. For now, the project focused on coffee shops in North American cities, but the same framework can be applied to any type of business.
