# yelp_nlp

This repository contains files related to an NLP project that compared topics that different Yelp users write about in reviews. I was particularly interested in whether reviews that were positive, "useful" (based on useful votes), or "elite" (Elite Yelp users) focused on different topics compared to other reviews, since positive/useful/Elite reviews are more valuable to businesses.

Data were obtained from the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). For now, the project focused on coffee shops in North American cities, but the same framework can be applied to any type of business.
